# IRIS Mirroring samples

In this repository we can find a set of samples to create mirroring without with script and avoid manual intervention.  

We use IRIS, ZPM Package manager and docker.  



If you are not a ZPM or docker user, this guide can be a good overview to transpose each step
to your system.
